# AppImages for SRB2Kart

To use just download the `.AppImage` of your choice from [here](https://github.com/Lonsfor/srb2k-appimage/releases/latest), make it executible (with GUI or Terminal) and run it.

Terminal example:
```
chmod +x srb2kart*.AppImage
./srb2kart*.AppImage
```

Ignore the `.zsync` files those are for the updating system.

### noassets:

If you download an AppImage without assets make sure you have them somewere else beforehand. In case you do not, they can be extracted from the [here](https://github.com/STJr/Kart-Public/releases/download/v1.5/AssetsLinuxOnly.zip). Place the `.kart`, `.srb`, `mdls` and `mdls.dat` files in `~/.srb2kart`.
